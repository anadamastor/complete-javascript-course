// JavaScript Fundamentals – Part 2
// Coding Challenge #1
// Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a new gymnastics discipline, which works differently.
// Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so one average score per team).
// A team only wins if it has at least double the average score of the other team. Otherwise, no team wins!
// Your tasks:
// 1. Createanarrowfunction'calcAverage'tocalculatetheaverageof3scores
// 2. Usethefunctiontocalculatetheaverageforbothteams
// 3. Createafunction'checkWinner'thattakestheaveragescoreofeachteam
// as parameters ('avgDolhins' and 'avgKoalas'), and then logs the winner to the console, together with the victory points, according to the rule above. Example: "Koalas win (30 vs. 13)"
// 4. Usethe'checkWinner'functiontodeterminethewinnerforbothData1and Data 2
// 5. Ignoredrawsthistime
// Test data:
// § Data 1: Dolphins score 44, 23 and 71. Koalas score 65, 54 and 49 § Data 2: Dolphins score 85, 54 and 41. Koalas score 23, 34 and 27
// Hints:
// § To calculate average of 3 values, add them all together and divide by 3
// § To check if number A is at least double number B, check for A >= 2 * B.
// Apply this to the team's average scores 😉

const calcAverage = (num1, num2, num3) => (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3;

const checkWinner = function (avgDolphins, avgKoalas) {

    return `Dolphins win (${avgDolphins} vs ${avgKoalas})`;

    return `Koalas win (${avgKoalas} vs ${avgDolphins})`;
